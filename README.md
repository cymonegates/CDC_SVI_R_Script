# CDC_SVI_R_Script
ATSDRâ€™s Geospatial Research, Analysis &amp; Services Program (GRASP) created Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index (CDC SVI or simply SVI) to help public health officials and emergency response planners identify and map the communities that will most likely need support before, during, and after a hazardous event. The SVI model was calculated using SQL programming language. This repository contains a reproduction of the CDC's SVI calculations in R so that the values can be updated yearly for the state of Arizona. All methods and background information for SVI can be found at: https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/documentation/SVI_documentation_2018.html
